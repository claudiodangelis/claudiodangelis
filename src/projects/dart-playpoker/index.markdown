This is just an experiment to approach the new Dart programming language.

It ain't supposed to be funny, educational, working fine, etc :-)

## Roadmap

 - A per-hand comparing method called when players share the same hand kind
 - Fix some random bugs, improve code and make it well **structured**
 - Build a **betting** system
 - Give the computer user a **brain**
 - Calculate **partial hand values** (required for previous item)
 - _Librarify_ the whole thing in order to make its parts reusable
